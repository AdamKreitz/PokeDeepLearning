## This is a set of fun Data Science/ML Projects using Pokemon

#### Project 1: Pokemap

This allows you to create ASCII representations of Pokemon maps in the terminal by specifying the dimensions you want.

Just download the .py script and execute in the terminal using:

python3 pokemap_nocolor.py

A version with colored text is coming (maybe)
